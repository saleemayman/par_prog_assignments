the exercise for loop transformations includes three assignments. In each assignment you have to transform a loop and use OpenMP pragmas for the parallelization. Every loop contains accesses to two-dimensional arrays of size (N,N).

Assignment 8.1

Apply loop-distribution to eliminate the loop-carried dependences. Other transformations may help to preserve dependences.

Assignment 8.2

Apply loop-alignment to eliminate the loop-carried dependences. The final statements may not contain any if-conditionals. Other transformations may help to preserve dependences.

Assignment 8.3

Apply loop-fusion and loop-alignment to transform the two loops into a parallel loop. Other transformations may help to preserve dependences.

Hints:

- Draw the dependency graph to get possible loop transformations and to     check   whether the    dependences are preserved.
- Remember all loop transformations from the lecture/tutorial.
- Consider the iteration bounds.
- Test programs are useful to check equality of the output.
